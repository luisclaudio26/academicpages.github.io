As an undergrad student, I gave a 1h talk on physically-based rendering to
other undergrad students, aiming to raise interest not only on rendering
itself but also to showcase how cool can the interplay between physics,
mathematics and computation can be. The talk covered all the basic concepts
behind raytracing, the physics involved, the intuition behind the rendering
equation and how the algorithms "map" to those equations.

After finishing the summer course on 2D computer graphics at IMPA, I "compressed"
the course content in a 5 day workshop and presented it to my undergrad colleagues
with the help of my friend Lucas Torres (who has no personal webpage yet). The
workshop covered topics like transformations, texture mapping and Bézier curves
in a complete hands-on manner, without diving much into the theoretical aspects
of these tools.

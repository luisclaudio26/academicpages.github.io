title: "A study on local feature descriptors for point clouds"
excerpt: "Bachelor's thesis"

I proposed and tested some local feature descriptors
for point clouds. My main goal was to handcraft features that performed well
(in terms of _descriptiveness_) on high clutter and noisy scenarios, such as
pattern recognition on Kinect point clouds. I found out that even the state-of-the-art
descriptors which have excelent performance on object retrieval tasks performed
poorly, and the features I proposed could at best perform close to these poor
results but being faster. As a subproduct of this project, I created a small
platform based on [Point Cloud Library](http://pointclouds.org/) to benchmark
the descriptiveness of various feature descriptors on the "classic" datasets, based
on the work of [Guo et al](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-015-0824-y).

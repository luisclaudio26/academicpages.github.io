title: "A study on local feature descriptors for point clouds"
excerpt: "Bachelor thesis"
collection: portfolio
---

My bachelor thesis consisted in a study of the _descriptiveness_ of feature descriptors
for keypoints in point clouds, also proposing some ideas for new descriptors in
an attempt to get good performance in noisy, cluttered scenarios.

For this project I developed a benchmark platform inspired on the work of [Guo et al](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-015-0824-y) to compare the
descriptors available on the [Point Cloud Library](http://pointclouds.org/) and
the new descriptors I created.

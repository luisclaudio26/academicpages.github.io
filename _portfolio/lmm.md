This was my final project for the Computation Photography course as an MSc. student at UFRGS.
The goal was to reproduce the results presented on the work by [Wu et al](http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/evm/) where one amplifies subtle motion present in
video sequences so we can see how things are moving and how fast.

You can check the first results in this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BLI_hfTb284gXjt4MgQFADQOKHBN59M4?usp=sharing)
along with the slideshow.

This is still work-in-progress so videos are still noisy and gray scale, although we
can see that motion was indeed amplified.

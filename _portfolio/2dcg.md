This is the vector graphics renderer developed during the summer course at
IMPA, which supports triangles, lines, quadratic and cubic BÃ©zier curves, texture
mapping, alpha blending and linear/radial gradients. In the end we were able to
render images with a variety of complex effects.

This course was very important to me as this was my very first computer graphics
class which sparkled my interest in this field.

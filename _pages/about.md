I earned my bachelor degree in Computer Science from UFRN and my masters from [Institute of Informatics](http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/site/) at UFRGS, working under the
advisal of [prof. Eduardo Gastal](http://inf.ufrgs.br/~eslgastal/) and [prof. Manuel de Oliveira](http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~oliveira/), having worked on image processing.
My interests include are primarily on computer graphics and light transport simulation, but I'm really interested in anything merging computer science and mathematics/physics.

I'm currently a MSc. student in computer science at the [Institute of Informatics](http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/site/) at UFRGS, working under the
advisal of [prof. Eduardo Gastal](http://inf.ufrgs.br/~eslgastal/) and [prof. Manuel de Oliveira](http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~oliveira/). I'm currently
doing research on image processing, but I'm also interested in light transport techniques, appearance modelling, raytracing and real-time rendering.

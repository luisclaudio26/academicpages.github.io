*UPDATE*: I found out that computer graphics industry is all about doing extremely hard work which requires tons of knowledge in a multitude of subfields from mathematics and computer science, and even so one gets paid just as much as a regular engineer who does easier work. Also, I found that it doesn't matter how much I study by myself, if I don't have a PhD degree from a top-tier university in Europe/NA, people won't even take their time to look at my CV. Knowing things isn't enough; one also needs to be born in the right place for things to work out, otherwise your life will be less about learning awesome stuff and more about trying to enroll in famous universities.

For all of this, I moved away from computer science to pursue the goal of becoming a psychiatrist - which, believe ir or not, is way simpler then becoming a junior engineer somewhere in the graphics field. My interest for computer science has not vanished, and still I study CS- and math- related topics daily. I hope one day I can join my interests in Medicine and Computer Science in some useful work which is also pleasant.

~~I earned my bachelor degree in Computer Science from UFRN and my masters from [Institute of Informatics](http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/site/) at UFRGS, working under the advisal of [prof. Eduardo Gastal](http://inf.ufrgs.br/~eslgastal/) and [prof. Manuel de Oliveira](http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~oliveira/), having worked on image processing.
My interests are primarily on computer graphics and light transport simulation, but I'm really interested in anything merging computer science and mathematics/physics.~~

### Abstract

In this paper we use a simplified model of the human visual system to explain why humans tend do 
prefer ''sharpened'' digital images. From this model we then derive a family of image prefilters specifically 
adapted to viewing conditions and user preference, allowing for the trade-off between ringing and aliasing while
maximizing image sharpness. We discuss how our filters can be applied in a variety of situations ranging from Monte 
Carlo rendering to image downscaling, and we show how they consistently give sharper results while having an efficient 
implementation and ease of use (there are no free parameters that require manual tuning). We demonstrate the effectiveness 
of our simple sharp prefilters through a user study that indicates a clear preference to our approach compared to the state-of-the-art.
